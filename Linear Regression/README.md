**Linear Regression with Regularization and Learning Rate Schedule**
This repository contains a Python implementation of Linear Regression, offering flexibility with L1 and L2 regularization, a learning rate schedule, and early stopping. The implementation is designed to be modular and suitable for educational purposes.

**Files**:
**1. LinearRegression.py**
LinearRegression.py is the core implementation of the Linear Regression class, providing the following features:

**Initialization Parameters**:

lr: Learning rate for gradient descent.
n_iters: Number of iterations for training.
regularization: Type of regularization ('l1', 'l2', or None).
alpha: Regularization strength.
decay_rate: Learning rate decay rate for scheduling.
early_stopping: Enable or disable early stopping.
patience: Number of epochs with no improvement to wait for early stopping.
Methods:

fit(X, y, val_set=None): Train the linear regression model.

**Parameters**:

X: Input features.
y: Target variable.
val_set: Validation set for early stopping (tuple of X_val, y_val).
predict(X): Make predictions using the trained model.

**Parameters**:

X: Input features for prediction.
__compute_regularization_term(): Internal method to compute the regularization term based on the selected type.

__update_learning_rate(iteration_number): Internal method to update the learning rate with decay scheduling.

**2. apply_LinearRegression.py**
apply_LinearRegression.py provides a practical example demonstrating the usage of the Linear Regression model on a synthetic dataset:

Import the LinearRegression class from LinearRegression.py.
Generate a synthetic dataset using scikit-learn.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the Linear Regression model with L2 regularization, learning rate scheduling, and early stopping.
Evaluate the model's performance and visualize the results.

**Usage**:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-regression-implementation.git
cd linear-regression-implementation
Run apply_LinearRegression.py:

python apply_LinearRegression.py
Feel free to explore the code, experiment with hyperparameters, and apply the model to your own datasets!

Note: Ensure you have NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib installed in your Python environment.
